This blog is designed to study computer vision-related fields. I would like to inform and share what I have learned, experienced, and what I will study in the future through this blog. So I hope that my knowledge and experience can be useful to those who need it.

~~~python
def main():
    print("Welcome to devpko's blog")

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:
`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`
Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
